# mcleonte.dsa

This repository is meant for personal learning, experimenting, documenting and
showcasing.

It contains my collection of fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms
developed while solving coding challenges on platforms such as Leetcode.

This collection also doubles as a target for experimenting with different
workflows, tools and features, such as version controlling, testing, packaging,
formatting, linting etc.
